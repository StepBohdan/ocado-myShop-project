**Ocado MyShop** is a lightweight application built with **React + Vite**.  
It allows users to browse products, manage a cart, and place an order with a clear.

This project was created as part of a recruitment task. It emphasizes clarity, state separation, modern practices (hooks, Context API), and production-aware deployment ([GitHub Pages](https://stepbohdan.github.io/ocado-myShop-project/)).

## ðŸ“Œ What does it do?

- Displays a list of products with name and price
- Allows users to add/remove products to/from the cart
- Lets users proceed to checkout and see a summary of their cart
- After confirmation, the user is redirected to a **static HTML confirmation page** with:
  - A message confirming order placement
  - A detailed summary of what was ordered
  - A link back to the store to start a new order

## ðŸ¤” Why this structure?

### âœ… Global cart state via `Context + useReducer`

The cart is stored using React Context + Reducer pattern because:

- It centralizes all state logic in one place
- It supports complex actions (`ADD`, `INC`, `DEC`, `REMOVE`, `CLEAR`)
- Reducers make the app easier to scale and test

### âœ… Persistence with `localStorage`

The cart and order confirmation are stored in `localStorage`, allowing:

- Data to survive refreshes
- Smooth transition from SPA to static confirmation page

### âœ… Static confirmation page

The order confirmation page is outside the React app (`public/order-confirmation.html`), and I chose this because:

- It shows that I'm able to handle cross-boundary communication using `localStorage`
- It simulates a real-world case where checkout/confirmation is sometimes handled by a separate system

### âœ… Clear separation of responsibilities

The application is divided into sections:

- `src/components/` â€“ reusable UI components such as `CartItem`, `Price`, `ProductCard`
- `src/pages/` â€“ page-level views: `ProductsPage`, `CartPage`, and `CheckoutPage`
- `src/context/CartContext.tsx` â€“ centralized state and general logic for the cart
- `src/styles/` â€“ modular SCSS styling for layout, components, and responsive design
- `public/` â€“ static assets and standalone HTML files

```

### ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
This project demonstrates ability to:

1. Structure and isolate application logic

2. Use modern React APIs efficiently (Context, Hooks, Reducer)

3. Work around SPA limitations

4. Build hybrid applications (SPA + static HTML)

The project is optimized for clarity, reusability, and clean code.

**I hope my understanding of the code is similar to what you're looking for.** ðŸ˜ƒ
